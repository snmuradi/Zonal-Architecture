# Zonal-Architecture
TPMS, HVAC, and BCM for Zonal Architecture
Overview
This project focuses on redesigning the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), and Body Control Module (BCM) for a zonal architecture in modern vehicles. Zonal architecture centralizes various electronic control systems, improving vehicle efficiency, safety, and flexibility.

The key goal of this project is to integrate these subsystems into a zonal-based vehicle system to optimize performance, reduce wiring complexity, and allow for more seamless communication between different vehicle components.

Project Components
